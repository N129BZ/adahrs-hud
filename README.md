# ahrs-hud - A Heads Up Display that uses Dynon, Garmin, or Stratux AHRS data, plus Stratux Traffic, for Experimental Aircraft

## This is a HUD (Heads Up Display) for Dynon, Garmin, or Stratux AHRS, using a Raspberry Pi Zero and one of the available EFIS serial ports on the Dynon or Garmin, or optionally the AHRS data from the Stratux. The pi's HDMI video port is then used to display the AHRS on a Hudly or Kivic HUD.

###### NOTE:
If you need to tweak the view of the HUD screen, the div.hud class in css/hud.css can be edited at the setting transform: scale(x, y) to scale the 2 dimensions to your liking, or even rotate 180Â° if mounting the HUD from the top of the windscreen. It is suggested to not change values for masks and tapes, as they are calibrated by number of pixels to offset based on the speed, altitude, or heading values being applied.
